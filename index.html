        In physics, spacetime is any mathematical model which fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional manifold. The fabric of space-time is a conceptual model combining the three dimensions of space with the fourth dimension of time.

        Until the 20th century, it was assumed that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its spatial expression in terms of coordinates, distances, and directions) was independent of one-dimensional time. The famous physicist Albert Einstein helped develop the idea of space-time as part of his theory of relativity. Prior to his pioneering work, scientists had two separate theories to explain physical phenomena: Isaac Newton's laws of physics described the motion of massive objects, while James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic models explained the properties of light. However, in 1905, Albert Einstein based a work on special relativity on two postulates:
        <ul class="common-lists">
            <li>The laws of physics are invariant (i.e., identical) in all inertial systems (i.e., non-accelerating frames of reference)</li>
            <li>The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.</li>
        </ul>

    A question that has perplexed philosophers and scientists since the dawn of man, <strong><em>‘What exactly is time?’</em></strong> and it has only been in our recent history that we have started to discover answers, thanks to Einstein and his work on special and general relativity. 
    <br><br>
    Now we know time is not an abstract concept we first thought it was, and it is not constant and is relative to different observers throughout the universe, with the speed of light being the only constant in the universe. In other words, if the speed of light has to be the same for everybody, then someone traveling at close to such a speed would find time to slow down. Fortunately, as all humans live within the boundaries of the planet Earth, it means the passing of time is very similar for us all (or so minutely different that it is impossible to measure). However, technologies such as satellites and GPS systems need to consider this altering state of time, else would be wholly inaccurate. As humans have progressed, telling the time with ever-increasing accuracy has become very important.
    <br><br>
    Historically, knowing the time was not so imperative. People needed to know the correct day to plant crops or when sunrise and sunset happened, but accuracy was not a preoccupation. However, since the invention of the mechanical clocks followed by the electronic clocks in the twentieth century, people started relying on them for their precision in technologies. Seafaring, aviation, and now space travel means that humans have sought more accurate ways of tracking time. Following that, in the 1950s, Atomic clocks were invented. These were so accurate that the revolution time of Earth, something we had based on our timescale for centuries, was nowhere near to these new clocks. Nowadays, technologies such as the Internet, the GPS (Global Positioning System), and satellite communication require high precision, as light can travel 300,000 km per second. Meaning accuracies of a split second could mean our satellite navigation systems could be out by thousands of miles, and computer trading would be almost impossible.
    <br><br>
    Fortunately, a global time scale, UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), has been developed and is based on the time told by atomic clocks. It helps systems all over the world to synchronize at the same time. Computer networks use the NTP protocol (Network Time Protocol) to receive a UTC timing reference and synchronize all machines on a network to that time. NTP servers can receive a time reference over the Internet (although not very secure) from a national radio transmission (as long as the receiver is within the suitable range) or from the GPS network (via a rooftop GPS antenna).
